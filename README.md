# Federated-Learning-Simulations

Summany:
#A collection of files that extracts a dataset, processes the data and then performs several Federated Learning simulation with said data.
Please see the instructions file.

Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm where multiple entities (Devices, organizations, people, etc.) cooperate in the training of a single, joint machine learning model but without sharing data. This allows to train the model using all the data but without anyone having to share sensitive data.

The dataset was made by people who had smartphones with them performing different physical activities and the devices picking up activity in their sensors. It was manually label and can be separated into 30 datasets, one for each participant.
